## Requirements

* An iPhone/iPad running iOS 8.0+
* Xcode 7.0 or above

## Build Instructions

If you're not install the Cocoapods on your machine, Run:

> $ gem install cocoapods
> $ pod setup

Download the source code

> $ git clone https://github.com/Aufree/phphub-ios

Now you'll need to build the dependencies

> $ pod install

Next you'll need to create your own version of environment-specific data. Make a copy of SecretConstant.example.h as SecretConstant.h:

> $ cp PHPHub/Constants/SecretConstant.example.h PHPHub/Constants/SecretConstant.h

Now you need to apply for a `Client_id` and a `Client_secret` in [this link](#) (Use in production environments).

Open `SecretConstant.h` and set it up.

Run this command to create a plist file for Jpush.

> $ cp PHPHub/PushConfig.example.plist PHPHub/PushConfig.plist

You can setup your Jpush appkey in `PHPHub/PushConfig.plist` if you want to use Jpush.

Run the application in the debug mode.

Select Product -> Scheme -> Edit Schemes -> Info -> Change Build Configuration to Debug mode.

**Important: You shouldn't test your code in production environment!**

Open `PHPHub.xcworkspace` in Xcode.

**Note: Don't open the .xcodeproj because we use Cocoapods now!**

That's it! Have Fun! :beers:
